Network Multiplayer Muggins Game

## Rules

Muggins, also known as All-Fives, is a domino game where 2, 3 or 4 players play. Players form a cyclic ring and the game play is turn-based on this ring. A game consists of rounds. At the beginning of each round each player draws from the collection of tiles a hand of 7 tiles at random that has to contain 4 or less of each number (0 through 6) if not double. In the first round of the game the first player is the one having the tile 3-2. If nobody has it, players each draw another tile from the boneyard until somebody has it. In each of the following rounds the *winner* of the previous round is the first player.

At any round players take turns playing based on the pre-determined cycle. A play entails making a move from player's hand in such a way that an end of the tile is connected to one of the ends of the **tableau** (the ground). If the current player doesn't have such a tile, they draw a tile from the boneyard until they have it. If the boneyard had tiles in the first place, no one should draw the last tile from there. If the current player still doesn't have a matching tile, they skip and it's now the next player's turn. A round ends when one of the players runs of out of tiles in their hand.

Each time a player *plays* (i.e., makes a move), their score is incremented by the sum of the ends of the tableau if this sum is divisible by 5 (hence the alternative name). Also, at the end of each round, the finishing player is awarded the sum of the other player's hand contents until their score becomes 300.

The game ends when one of the players finishes a round with their score at least 365 points.

The first double tile that's enclosed from both sides on a tableau is called a **line** and it forms two additional directions of potential play â€” orthogonal to the original axis of the game. If the tableau doesn't have a line, then it has only two ends. Otherwise, it might have two, three or four ends depending on whether and how many of the directions of its line has game play along it.

If it makes the sum of the ends divisible by 5, a player can drop for as many ends of the game as possible at once, and is awarded this sum.
